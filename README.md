Wadalis, Now they have an offical homepage.


## why i chose Wadali Brother?
I saw a komedi show Kapil Sharma show, the most popular show in india. Kapil invited Wadali bros
i was so impressed by them as persons and as singers. When i read that i should make a website about some kind
of band, Wadalis was the first thing which came to my mind.

which is included in the pictures and saved as a pdf Wireframe. I have used diffrent kind of tech in this which
did satisfie me a lot. At the End i am very satisfied with
this project.

of sufi music it is.
