This is my first project made by my self, 
quesions which came to my mind.
1. why i chose Wadali Brother?
I saw a komedi show Kapil Sharma show, the most popular show in india. Kapil invited Wadali bros
i was so impressed by them as persons and as singers. When i read that i should make a website about some kind
of band, Wadalis was the first thing which came to my mind.

2. Why i chose this Design?
 I actually did not no, because i was a bit behind when it comes to my project. I did
not think so much and started and went with the flow.
Then i realized that i should have put everything on paper. in the whole i am very satisfied with
this project.

3. What about coding?
I really enjoy this right now, becasue at the end, what matters is if i am having fun.
I love this right now. I am enjoying it. I know i can and i will become a gr8 coder.
